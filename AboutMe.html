		My name is Damian Kowalczyk. I am currently a student at Illinois Institute of Technology going for a Bachelors in Computer Science. I have been passionate about Computer Science since High School, where I decided to begin learning Java in my free time. In high school, I took every coding class offered, which sadly wasn't an extensive list. So I would often spend my free time looking up interesting things and trying to recreate them or learning how they work. This interest continued to grow, leading me to decide that I wanted to pursue Computer Science as my Major in college.

		One of my biggest passions is teaching children about STEM. I spent some time in my High School helping develop a short 2 class curriculum in which we taught Freshmen the basics in coding using Spheros. I remember specifically there was this one girl, she was very shy and sat in the corner, however after I taught them the basics and let them play sound she got very excited. After my lesson ended she ended up coming up to me and talking to me about how she can continue with coding. This was when my passion for teaching STEM started and only continued as I helped my school develop its makerspace and eventually was hired to help them within the IT department. I believe that everyone should be introduced to STEM at least once in their life and that there is something fun and enjoyable in it for everyone.
