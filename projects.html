		Dark Matter Data Processer
	</h2>
	<p>
		In this project, I worked with a scientist named Steve Kuhlman from Argonne National Laboratory. I was asked to use python to splice the data in order to remove the imporatnt data, and then input that data onto multiple charts and graphs using Matplotlib. Finally, once all the data is graphed, I output it all in pdf format. The data was raw data collected from some of their dark matter experiments.

		Binary into Mips Decompiler
	</h2>
	<p>
		In my CS351-Systems Programming class, my final project was to create a binary into Mips Assembly decompiler, where I would input a file into my program which consisted of only binary code, and it would then be translated into working Mips code.

	<h2>
		Basic Machine Learning Program
	</h2>
	<p>
		In my free time I wanted to learn the basics of Machine learning so I created this very basic program. Each dot wants to get to the red dot at the end, and once one of them touch it, they compete to see who gets there the feastest. New generation tend to mutate off of the best dot of the previous generation, which is the green one. I still plan to add some functuanality to this, such as making it so you can create the obstacles with your mouse before the dots begin moving.

	<h2>
		Simple Database
	</h2>
	<p>
		In my CS420-Database Organization class, my final project was making a functional database for an imaginary company in a mix of SQL and Java. We had the database able to handle what employees were working in the company, what viewing rights they had, each employee had their own user id and password. We also had the system handle customers and orders, with sales and administrators able to fill out orders and the system would notify the employee how long until the order comes in or if we had it in stock. Finally, the database also included a visual GUI, making the whole thing very user-friendly.
